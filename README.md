# code-generator-and-validator

A simple code validation implementation. <br />
Generates a 6 digit code for a email, and also allows the user to validate the code. <br />

To-do:
  - try and implement rate-limiting - so that user cannot bombard the server with new code generation requests, also same with validation.
  - code generation can be done more better.
  - code can be encrypted instead of plain text.
